# 3. Recursion

- The idea of defining something in terms of itself
- Very closely bound up with the idea of mathematical induction.
- Two things to consider when writing recursive programs:
  1. How will it terminate _(base case)_?
  1. How will it break up the data it works one?
- Example of a _divide-and-conquer_ strategy.

## Examples

- In Prolog, a list is either an empty list, or a term connected to a list.
- Someone's ancestor can be one of their parents, or an ancestor of one of their parents.
- We can reverse a list of terms by taking the first element off, reversing the rest, and putting the first element on the end.
